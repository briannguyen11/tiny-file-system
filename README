2. Our TinyFS implementation works very well. We implemented the Block Device Driver,
   core functionality, and additional functions that all work as expected. One tradeoff
   we made was that according to our design, we only know an inode exists for a file
   after it has been written. This is because we wanted to initialized the inode and file
   context blocks only once we know the size of the file.

3. Additional functionality:

   - Fragmentation info and defragmentation:
     Fragmentation info is shown using a grid that displays the block type of all the
     blocks in a disk. The tfs_displayFragments() function is called after new files are
     created to show that they have been added to the disk. Defragmentation is demonstrated
     when a file is deleted, tfs_defrag() is called, and then tfs_displayFragments() is called
     to show that a file has been deleted and then all the remaining files have been shifted
     such that there are no free space blocks between inode and file content blocks.
   - Directory listing and file renaming:
     Calling tfs_rename() changes the name of a file and tfs_readdir() displays all files in the
     disk. tfs_readdir() is called before and after renaming to show that the file's name has changed.
   - Read-only and writeByte support:
     tfs_makeRO() is used by setting a file to read-only initially and then trying to delete the
     file, but it will be not be deleted. tfs_makeRW() is called which then allows the file to be
     deleted. tfs_writeByte() is called on a file to overwrite half of its bytes to be "x". seek()
     moves the cursor back and then the bytes are then read with readBytes() to show that they have
     in fact been read.
   - Timestamps:
     tfs_readFileInfo() is called after writeFile to show the base create, modification, and
     access times. Its called after readByte() to show that the access time has changed and its
     called after writeByte() to show that the modification and access times have changed.

4. Limitations:
   If you close a file, it will not be displayed in the readdir.
